The module is a customized version of the [PHG4SimpleEventGenerator](https://e1039-collaboration.github.io/e1039-doc/master/d5/df3/classPHG4SimpleEventGenerator.html) multiparticle gun. It uses true dimuon kinematics to filter unwanted events and provides better control to generate combinatorial dimuon mass, designed for the E1039 experiment.
